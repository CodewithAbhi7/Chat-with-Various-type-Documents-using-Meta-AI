# Chat with Various type Documents using Meta AI

This Streamlit application allows you to ask questions about scientific documents and receive answers based on the content. It utilizes text extraction from various file formats and leverages the power of a pre-trained language model for information retrieval.

## Features:

* Extract text from PDF, DOCX, HTML, and image files.
* Process extracted text into meaningful chunks.
* Handle user questions and provide answers based on the document content.
* Maintain a chat history for previous interactions.

## Note:

This application relies on the `meta_ai_api` library, which serves as a mock for a real Meta AI API. Thanks to the work of [@Strvm](https://github.com/Strvm) at at [Strvm/meta-ai-api](https://github.com/Strvm/meta-ai-api) on this library, we don't require an actual Meta AI API key.
